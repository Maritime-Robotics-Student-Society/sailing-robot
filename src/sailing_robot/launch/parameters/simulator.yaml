# Wind conditions:
# wind speed in m/s (1m/s = 1.9kts)
simulation/wind/speed: 5

# wind direction relative to north
simulation/wind/direction: 305

# A gaussian noise is generated on both wind speed and wind direction, use a value of 0 to remove the noise generation.
# These parameters are the 'width' of the gaussian distribution
simulation/wind/noise_direction_range: 5        # [degree]
simulation/wind/noise_speed_range: 0.5          # [m/s]


# Boat velocity
# velocity of the boat at 90° from the wind in with 1 m/s wind speed 
# for example in a 10kts wind, if the boat goes at 3kts, the coefficient is 0.3
simulation/velocity/coefficient: 0.4

# Minimum velocity of the boat (in m/s)
simulation/velocity/minimum: 0.5

# Time after a tack the boat velocity is reduced [s]
simulation/velocity/tacking_punishment_time: 3 # [s]
        
# the velocity will be multiplied by the following coefficient after each tack
simulation/velocity/tacking_punishment_coefficient: 0.2

# Heading coefficient
# just a multiplicator coefficient for the heading control in case of need
